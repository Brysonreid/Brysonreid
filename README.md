- 👋 Hi, I’m @Brysonreid
- 👀 I’m interested in physics, engineering, computer science, and learning new things everyday.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning complex topics in physics such as special reletivity, waves, and electromagnetics. I'm also learning new coding languages like Java, and
- how to use machine learning algorithms for different projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new projects where I can use different machine learning topics to solve problems. I am also interested in working on back end programing
- for complex problems.
